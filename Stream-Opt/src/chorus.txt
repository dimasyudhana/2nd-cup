Waiting to time will i be better or fall
Play a lovely melody or nothing at all
Seeking my pride when there else nothing to hide
Let me just waking up together with you

Thinking of fantasy when there's no more privacy
Faking a smile there's no reason to cry
It's breaking my mind to see the truth is a lie
Let me just waking up together with you

There's no logic in life but darling love is
understandable

Tell me the price then I'll try to compromise
Power and politics leads time to collapse
It's breaking my heart to hear the truth is a lie
Let me just waking up together with you

There's no logic in life but darling love is
understandable

I'm not a prodigy it is just my agony
The plants in my hand i have to risk it all
It's hurting my eye to see what's going on
Let me just waking up together with you

Waking up tomorrow with you
Waking up together with you
